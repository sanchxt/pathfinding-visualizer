# Pathfinding algorithms visualizer

Visualizes these 4 pathfinding algorithms:

- BFS
- DFS
- A-Star
- Dijkstra

Shows what paths these algorithms traverse, and which one they end up choosing.

> Can create your own grids, or run algorithms to automatically generate one.

**To run:**

`git clone https://github.com/sanchxt/pathfinding-visualizer`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`
